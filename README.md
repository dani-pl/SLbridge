# SLbridge

## Overview
SLbridge simplifies accessing SL (Stockholm Public Transport) tickets alongside NFC-enabled services like Google Pay on the same device.
It solves the common issue where users inadvertently pay with Google Pay instead of using their SL ticket at terminals equipped with NFC readers.

## Features
- Automatically opens SL's QR code ticket screen if NFC is off.
- Opens NFC settings to deactivate NFC, ensuring SL app access without unintended Google Pay transactions.
- Ideal for users frequently switching between Google Pay and SL apps.

## How to Use
1. Install SLbridge.
2. (Recommendation) Set a shortcut (e.g., double press power button) for quick access.
3. When needed:
    - NFC off: SLbridge opens SL's ticket screen.
    - NFC on: SLbridge opens NFC settings for you to deactivate NFC. Go back, reopen (eg, with the previously set shortcut) SLbridge or open SL app to open SL's ticket screen.

## Compatibility
For Android devices.

## Disclaimer
SLbridge is independent of SL or Google Pay, developed for user convenience.
